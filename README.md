## Core Features
* Extract web content based on XPath-, Regex-, (Javascript-), and Python Format Expressions
* Crawls through complex graphs of webpages using expressive match chains and forwarding rules
* Selenium support, explicitly also for headless mode and for the Tor Browser
* REPL mode for quick and dirty jobs / debugging larger commands
* **dd** style Command-line Interface
* Multithreaded downloads with optional progress output on the console
* Interactive modes for rejecting false matches, adjusting filenames etc.

## Setup

SCR can be installed from pypi.org using

```bash
pip install scr
```

Selenium drivers for Firefox/Tor (``geckodriver``), and chrome/chromium
(``chromedriver``) can be installed e.g. using
```
scr selinstall=firefox
``` 
(and later updated e.g. using ``scr selupdate=chrome``).
You still need to have the browser installed, though.


## Examples

### Download and enumerate all images from a website into the current working directory:
```bash
scr url=google.com cx='//img/@src' cl csf="img_{ci}{fe}" 
```

### Open up a REPL, remote controlling a Firefox Browser using selenium
```bash
scr repl sel=firefox url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/web_scraping"
scr> 'cx=//span[text()="Edit"]/parent::*/parent::*/@id' cjs="document.getElementById(cx).children[0].click()"
scr> exit
```

### Interactively scroll through top reddit posts, following the 'next page' buttons:
```bash
scr url=old.reddit.com dx='//span[@class="next-button"]/a/@href' cx='//div[contains(@class,"entry")]//a[contains(@class,"title")]/text()' din mt=0
```

### Downloading first 3 pdfs and first 5 gifs from a site, use a headless selenium tor browser for the fetch:
```bash
scr url=https://dtc.ucsf.edu/learning-library/resource-materials/ cx=//@href cr0='.*\.pdf$' cr1='.*\.gif$' cl csf='{fn}' cin=1 cimax0=3 cimax1=5 sel=tor selh
```


## Options List
```
scr [OPTIONS]

    Matching chains are evaluated in the following order, skipping unspecified steps:
    xpath -> regex -> (javascript) -> python format string

    Content to Write out:
        cx=<xpath>            xpath for content matching
        cr=<regex>            regex for content matching
        cjs=<js string>       javascript to execute on the page, format args are available as js variables (selenium only)
        cf=<format string>    content format string (args: <cr capture groups>, xmatch, rmatch, di, ci)
        cmm=<bool>            allow multiple content matches in one document instead of picking the first (defaults to true)
        cimin=<number>        initial content index, each successful match gets one index
        cimax=<number>        max content index, matching stops here
        cicont=<bool>         don't reset the content index for each document
        csf=<format string>   save content to file at the path resulting from the format string, empty to enable
        cwf=<format string>   format to write to file. defaults to "{c}"
        cpf=<format string>   print the result of this format string for each content, empty to disable
                              defaults to "{c}\n" if cpf, csf and cfc are unspecified
        cfc=<chain spec>      forward content match as a virtual document
        cff=<format string>   format of the virtual document forwarded to the cfc chains. defaults to "{c}"

        lr=<regex>           regex for label matching
        ljs=<js string>      javascript to execute on the page, format args are available as js variables (selenium only)
        lf=<format string>   label format string
        lic=<bool>           match for the label within the content match instead of the hole document
        las=<bool>           allow slashes in labels
        lmm=<bool>           allow multiple label matches in one document instead of picking the first (for all content matches)
